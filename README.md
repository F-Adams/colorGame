This application was created while following a code-along project in a WebDev bootcamp on Udemy.
The bootcamp was developed and presented by Colt Steele.

This application demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together to create an interactive web page.
It is a sort of "game" which not only contributed to my learning of Web Development concepts and skills,
but also advanced my expert (not really) knowledge of HTML RGB color codes.

Originally the application only had two difficulty levels. I modified the code myself to include a third difficulty level!
The original code still exists, I simply commneted it out and added my changes.  It was a rediculously simple modification, I simply wanted to see if I could do it successfully.

Instructions:
- When the page loads, you will be presented with several colored squares.
- You can choose any of the three difficulty levels by clicking either "Easy", "Medium" (the default), or "Hard". The number of squares will change beased on the chosen difficulty.
- Each square is colored with a random color. You can change colors by clicking on "New Colors"
- At the top of the page is an RGB color value.
- To play, you simply clock on the square that matches the color value listed at the top.
- If you click the wrong colored square, the square will vanish and you will see a "Try Again" message.
- If you click the correct square, The top of the page will change to the correct RGB color and you will see a "Correct!" message.
- Click "Play Again" to reset the page with a new RGB value and colored squares.

If you are unfamiliar with RGB color values, you can learn about them on W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp
